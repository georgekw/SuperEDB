Coding assingments from the course TMA4280 Supercomputing, NTNU

The objective of this problem set was to generate a vector v, 
where the elements was given by the function v(i) = 1/i² ; i = 1, ... ,n. 
Then we were to compute the sum Sn of all the elements in the vector.
Finally we were to compare the difference between the sum Sn and S = pi²/6.

Compile and run information can be found in the run scripts for each file.
